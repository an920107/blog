## Development

- Frontend: Next.js
- Backend: Go (gin)

Despite Next.js being a full-stack framework, I still decided to adopt a separate front-end and back-end architecture for this blog project. I believe that this separation makes the project cleaner, reduces coupling, and aligns with modern development practices.  Furthermore, I wanted to practice developing a purely back-end API.

As for the more detailed development approach, I plan to use Clean Architecture for the overall structure and ATDD for testing. Of course, such a small project may not necessarily require such complex design patterns, but I want to give myself an opportunity to practice them.

These will allow me to become more proficient in these modern development practices and leave a lot of flexibility and room for adjustments in the future.
